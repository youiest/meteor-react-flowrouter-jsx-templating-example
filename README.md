# Example Isomorphic Meteor+React app (with SSR and FlowRouter).



> Try turning off JavaScript, it will still render the intial  state of the app, as expected! [Here's a Chrome plugin to turn JavaScript off.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-javascript-switcher/geddoclleiomckbhadiaipdggiiccfje)
